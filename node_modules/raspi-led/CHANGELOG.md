## 2.1.1 (2019-2-20)

- Updated dependencies

## 2.1.0 (2018-12-6)

- Updated TypeScript to v3. Note: the compiled output changed as I previously didn't set the compiled output target flag correctly.
- Added `module` export to conform with Core IO types

## 2.0.0 (2017-9-12)

- BREAKING CHANGE: dropped support for Node.js < 4.0.0, and now enforce it via package.json "engines" field.
- SORT OF BREAKING-ISH CHANGE: dropped support for attempting to install on non-arm platforms via package.json's "cpu" field.
    - Attempting to install this on a non-Raspberry Pi platform before gave a bunch of obtuse errors, so this doesn't _actually_ change the ability to install raspi-gpio, but does make it fail earlier and harder.
- Added a new instance method `hasLed()` that returns if a system LED was dedected or not for this instance

## 1.5.5 (2017-22-1)

- Publishing a new version to update the README on npmjs.com. No other changes.

## 1.5.4 (2016-12-21)

- Added missing TypeScript definition package.json entry

## 1.5.3 (2016-12-21)

- Forgot to explicitly mark the methods as public in the TypeScript definition.
  - Note: methods are public by default, so there isn't technically a change, but it's good to be explicit about these things

  - Note: there is no functionality change or bug fixes with this release
