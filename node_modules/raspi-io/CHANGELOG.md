## 10.0.2 (2019-4-15)

- Fixed a bug where GPIO pins were not marked as PWM pins correctly

## 10.0.1 (2019-2-21)

- Brought in an updated dependency

## 10.0.0 (2019-2-21)

- BREAKING CHANGE: Under the hood we now use the PWM clock instead of the PCM clock for software PWM.
    - You can no longer use hardware PWM with Raspi IO (which Raspi IO itself does not support)
    - You now _can_ use I2S in conjunction with Raspi IO
- BREAKING CHANGE: there is no longer a default export. Instead use `const Raspi = require('raspi-io').RaspiIO` or `import { RaspiIO as Raspi } from 'raspi-io';` to get the old behavior to work
- Added a new constructor property `enableI2C` that allows users to programatically enable or disable I2C
- BREAKING CHANGE: The `name` property of this module now returns `"Raspi IO"` instead of `"RasperryPi-IO"` to conform with naming conventions elsewhere
- BREAKING CHANGE: removed the `enableSoftPwm` and switched to using software PWM by default for all pins
    - Note: this means that hardware PWM is not used on the pins that support hardware PWM, we still use software PWM
- BREAKING CHANGE: `digital-read-${pin}` event names are now normalized. If, for example, you called `digitalRead("GPIO18", () => {})` on the Raspberry Pi, before the event name would be `digital-read-GPIO18`, but now it's `digital-read-1`

Under the hood, I switched from `raspi-io-core`@2.x.x to `j5-io`@3.x.x. Note: J5 IO is a major rewrite of Raspi IO Core. Check out [J5 IO's changelog](https://github.com/nebrius/core-io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details. Note that many of those breaking changes are not surfaced in Raspi IO, and all breaking changes are listed above.


## 9.0.1 (2018-12-10)

- Updated raspi-board to the latest version, which includes breaking changes. These changes are not surfaced by Raspi IO.

## 9.0.0 (2018-4-21)

- Updated dependencies
- BREAKING CHANGE: Dropped support for Node.js 4

## 8.1.1 (2018-4-02)

- Pulled in latest version of raspi-io-core to switch servo methods to using range instead of degrees

## 8.1.0 (2017-9-12)

- Enforced support for Node.js < 4.0.0 via package.json "engines" field.
    - This does not change the actual supported platforms for Raspi IO, just makes it more explicit
- Dropped support for attempting to install on non-arm platforms via package.json's "cpu" field.
    - Attempting to install this on a non-Raspberry Pi platform before gave a bunch of obtuse errors, so this doesn't _actually_ change the ability to install raspi-io, but does make it fail earlier, harder, and more obviously
- Updated dependencies that had breaking changes in prep for adding 1-wire support.
    - The breaking changes in dependencies are not surfaced as breaking changes in Raspi IO itself.

## 8.0.1(2017-4-29)

- Pulled in a dependency change that fixes a bug in servo duty cycle calculation

## 8.0.0 (2017-4-23)

- Updated dependencies that gets rid of Wiring Pi in favor of pigpio.
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: there are no _known_ breakages with this update, but there are a lot of under the hood changes, and better safe than sorry.
- Disabled serial on the Raspberry Pi Zero W by default because it suffers from the same serial limitations as the Raspberry Pi 3

## 7.4.0 (2017-4-19)

- Added proper Raspberry Pi Zero W support, which sets `enableSerial` to false

## 7.3.1 (2017-4-7)

- Dependency bump

## 7.3.0 (2017-4-7)

- Added `enableSerial` property to get around crashing on the Raspberry Pi 3

## 7.2.4 (2017-2-17)

- Updated raspi-io-core to bring in better error messaging around pin modes

## 7.2.3 (2017-22-1)

- Publishing a new version to update the README on npmjs.com

## 7.2.2 (2017-1-9)

- Updated dependencies to pull in a bug fix

## 7.2.1 (2017-1-5)

- Bumped the raspi-gpio dependency. There is a potentially breaking change in raspi-gpio, but because of how this module uses it, there is no breaking change here.

## 7.2.0 (2016-12-30)

- Split off almost all functionality of this module into [Raspi IO Core](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io-core)
  - Note: there should be no functionality change from this package, but giving it a minor version bump anyways
  - By splitting this off, it should be possible to create variants of raspi-io that target different OSes and configurations, e.g. Windows 10 IoT Core

## 7.1.0 (2016-11-29)

- Added support for software-based PWM

## 7.0.0 (2016-11-25)

- Fixed a bug where writing 0 to GPIO pins on startup wasn't actually writing 0
- Updated dependencies
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: removed dependency on raspi-wiringpi because Raspbian now ships with Wiring Pi by default. This _may_ break other OSes
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: I2C introduced a breaking change around write size limits, see the [raspi-i2c changelog](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-i2c/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more info.

## 6.2.0 (2016-11-22)

## 6.0.0 (2016-3-20)

- Added support for the `serial*` methods
  - BREAKING CHANGE: `GPIO14` and `GPIO15` are no longer accessible from raspi-io
- Removed the Symbol shim
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Node 0.10 is no longer supported
- Fixed a bug where I2C reads emitted the wrong event name
  - It was `I2C-reply${address}-${register}`, but is now `i2c-reply-${address}-${register}`
- Fixed a bug where the built-in LED no longer worked

- Stubbed out the `serialWrite`, `serialRead`, and `serialConfig`
    - For now, they throw a "not implemented" error

- Added support for enabling pull up resistors by writing HIGH to the pin while in INPUT mode
- Updated dependencies to add Ubuntu support

## 5.1.0 (2015-12-8)

- Updated dependencies to add Raspberry Pi Zero support

## 5.0.0 (2015-10-27)

- Upgraded to NAN 2
  - POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE
  - The API has not changed, but the build requirements have

## 4.1.0 (2015-10-13)

## 4.0.0 (2015-9-4)

- Reworked the I2C pins so that they CANNOT be used for GPIO.
  - This is to work around an issue where we can't change the pin mode back to
    I2C once we change it to GPIO
- WARNING: BOTH OF THESE CHANGES ARE POTENTIALLY BREAKING!
