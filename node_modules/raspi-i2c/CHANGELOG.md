## 6.2.2 (2019-2-20)

- Updated dependencies

## 6.2.1 (2019-1-10)

- Got rid of duplicate callback TypeScript types and tightened up the code a bit as a result. No behavior change outside of TypeScript.

## 6.2.0 (2018-12-10)

- Updated TypeScript to v3. Note: the compiled output changed as I previously didn't set the compiled output target flag correctly.
- Added `module` export to conform with Core IO types
- Updated to i2c-bus v4.
    - Note: there are breaking changes in i2c-bus 4, but they are not surfaced in raspi-i2c.

## 6.1.2 (2018-4-21)

- Updated to i2c-bus v3.
    - Note: there are breaking changes in i2c-bus v3, but they are not surfaced in raspi-i2c.

## 6.1.1 (2018-1-16)

- Fixed a bug where readWord wasn't properly swizzling the registerOrCb argument as a register when all parameters supplied

## 6.1.0 (2017-9-15)

- Removed logic for parsing pin information passed to the constructor
    - Normally this would be a breaking change, but it was already broken and the current behavior does nothing anyways, meaning there isn't _actually_ a change in behavior. Funny that.
    - Eventually, I want to rework this to provide support for multiple busses.

## 6.0.0 (2017-9-12)

- POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: renamed the following private properties to begin with an underscore because I just learned TypeScript doesn't do anything to hide private properties. Don't use these properties, changes may not be semver-major next time.
    - `I2C.devices` -> `I2C._devices`
    - `I2C.getDevice` -> `I2C._getDevice`
- BREAKING CHANGE: dropped support for Node.js < 4.0.0, and now enforce it via package.json "engines" field.
- SORT OF BREAKING-ISH CHANGE: dropped support for attempting to install on non-arm platforms via package.json's "cpu" field.
    - Attempting to install this on a non-Raspberry Pi platform before gave a bunch of obtuse errors, so this doesn't _actually_ change the ability to install raspi-i2c, but does make it fail earlier and harder.

## 5.0.4 (2017-5-20)

- Fixed a bug in `writeSync` where we weren't properly swizzling arguments.

## 5.0.3 (2017-22-1)

- Publishing a new version to update the README on npmjs.com. No other changes.

## 5.0.2 (2016-12-30)

- Added some important documentation to the README that needs to be on npmjs.com
  - Note: there are no code changes, only documentation

## 5.0.1 (2016-12-21)

- Added missing TypeScript definition package.json entry

## 5.0.0 (2016-12-21)

- Made all write callbacks optional
- Normalized read and write callbacks so that error is always null if no error occured
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: If you were using `err === undefined` or something similar, this will no longer work
- Normalized write callbacks so they only take an error argument
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANCE: If you were relying on the undocumented extra parameters to the write callback, these will now be `undefined`
- Converted the project to TypeScript and cleaned up a bunch of odds and end

## 4.0.0 (2016-11-23)

- Removed 32 byte length limitation when reading/writing directly to the bus and not to a register
  - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: if you were relying on the exception being thrown in this situation, you'll need to update your code.

## 3.1.1 (2016-10-29)
